# fivem-treasure-hunt
Fivem treasure hunt script, very customizable, and is made for Esx framework.  

Add the treasure_hunt to Your Server resources

Add start treasure_hunt to your server.cfg file to ensure the script loads when the server starts.

Cooldown: The server now tracks when each treasure was last collected and ensures that players cannot collect the same treasure again until the cooldown period has passed.

Tracking: The client script now tracks whether each treasure has been found and prevents duplicate collection until the cooldown resets.

Notification: Players receive a notification if they attempt to collect a treasure that is still on cooldown.

Feel free to adjust the cooldown time and other configurations as needed to better fit your serverâ€™s gameplay.
